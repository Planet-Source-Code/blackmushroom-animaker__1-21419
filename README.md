## Animaker


</div>

### Description

You want to make a jump'n run? Ever thought about how to make the

player walk left or jump or press a button? I'm sure you will spend a lot of time

(and code) indexing the sprite-frames, countdown the animations and

so on... So here's a solution:

This application provides an editor to set up animation-sequences

and sprite-descriptions from any bitmap. The sprites can even have

different sizes! It also features an "engine" (a single module) to

add to your game, where you can display your animations with only two

lines of code! Useful for jump'n runs or arcade-shooter, although it is

NOT a 2D graphic-engine (but easy to use in combination).
