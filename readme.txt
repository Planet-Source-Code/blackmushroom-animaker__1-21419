Animaker

(c) 2001 by BlackMushroom

You want to make a jump'n run? Ever thought about how to make the
player walk left or jump or press a button? I'm sure you will spend a lot of time
(and code) indexing the sprite-frames, countdown the animations and
so on... So here's a solution:
This application provides an editor to set up animation-sequences
and sprite-descriptions from any bitmap. The sprites can even have 
different sizes! It also features an "engine" (a single module) to
add to your game, where you can display your animations with only two 
lines of code! Useful for jump'n runs or arcade-shooter, although it is 
NOT a 2D graphic-engine (but easy to use in combination).
